    "# Advanced Modeling for Titanic Survival Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "After establishing a baseline understanding of the Titanic dataset through exploratory data analysis and initial predictive modeling, the next step involves applying advanced machine learning algorithms to enhance predictive performance and uncover deeper patterns in the data. Survival on the Titanic was influenced by a variety of interacting factors—such as passenger class, age, gender, and family connections—many of which are non-linear and not easily captured by simplistic models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this advanced modeling phase, we implement and compare the effectiveness of several powerful classification algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Logistic Regression**\n",
    "* **Random Forest Classifier**\n",
    "* **XGBoost Classifier**\n",
    "* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these models brings unique strengths to the table. By comparing these models across evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC, we aim to identify the most suitable approach for accurately predicting passenger survival. The outcome of this analysis will not only refine the predictive model but also provide insights into the critical factors that contributed to survival, shedding light on one of the most historically significant maritime disasters through the lens of modern data science."
