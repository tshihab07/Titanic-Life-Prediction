    "# Baseline Modeling For Titanic Life Prediction with Logistic Regression\n",
    "Establish a simple, interpretable baseline model for Titanic survival prediction using logistic regression. This provides a benchmark performance metric and helps identify key predictive features before exploring more complex algorithms.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**\n",
    "- Use encoded categorical features and numerical variables\n",
    "- Apply logistic regression for binary classification (survived/did not survive)\n",
    "- Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score\n",
    "- Analyze feature coefficients to understand survival factors<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcomes**\n",
    "- Baseline accuracy score for comparison with advanced models\n",
    "- Identification of most influential survival predictors\n",
    "- Foundation for iterative model improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Logistic Regression\n",
    "A statistical machine learning algorithm used for binary classification problems. It predicts the probability of an event occurring (survival in this case) by fitting data to a logistic function.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics**\n",
    "- Binary Output: Perfect for yes/no predictions (survived/not survived)\n",
    "- Probability Estimates: Provides likelihood scores between 0 and 1\n",
    "- Interpretable: Coefficients show feature importance and direction\n",
    "- Linear Decision Boundary: Assumes linear relationship between features and log-odds<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Use for Titanic?**\n",
    "- Simple & Fast: Quick to implement and train\n",
    "- No Feature Scaling Required: Works well with mixed feature scales\n",
    "- Interpretable Results: Easy to explain which factors influence survival\n",
    "- Robust Baseline: Provides reliable performance benchmark<br>\n",
    "Logistic regression serves as an excellent starting point for understanding the Titanic dataset before advancing to more complex modeling techniques."
